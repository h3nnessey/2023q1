Hi, my name is Vitaly, I'm 25 years old and this is my self-introduction video.

This presentation is made in Q&A format, so I will read the questions and answer them by myself.

1. How and why did you come to RS School?
  - I was already learning Javascript at the time I heard about RS School in the random interview video. I decided to check it out and was pleasantly surprised by the school's curriculum, so I decided to try the course.

2. Where are you from?
  - I currently live in Perm, Russia.

3. What about your education?
  - I finished the 11th grade of school in Perm, passed my exams and applied to several universities.
Later I successfully entered one of them and it was PSU (Perm State University). Faculty of Physics in the program "Applied Mathematics and Physics". After one year of study I was completely bored. I was not interested in studying there, I was no longer interested in physics and I decided to quit and take my documents. After that I served one year in the army and did not make any more attempts to go anywhere and continue my education.

4. Why did you get interested in programming?
  - I was motivated to try programming by my working environment on my computer - I used autohotkey and nodeJS scripts a lot. I wondered how it really worked, so I decided to try to learn programming.


5. What technologies are you interested in and what are you planning to study next?
  - Currently I'm interested in Javascript & Typescript as programming languages. NodeJS platform for server side development and ReactJS for frontend. In the near future I want to try server side rendering for React (its NextJS I guess), some Angular and Vue for general understanding of frameworks and their differences, NestJs for server side development (it looks like Angular for frontend I guess). Basically, I'm open to learning new technologies for myself, but it takes too much time and it's better not to waste it on everything you see.

6. What are your professional plans for programming?
  - I'm not burning with the desire to quit my current job and look for a new job as a junior developer, but it would be great to get a job as a developer somewhere in the near future.
7. What are your character traits that help you keep learning about programming?
  - It's perseverance, I guess. I can't go to bed until I've found a solution or fixed a bug.
